# Texture replacement example

This is an example of 3D image dataset creation using **texture replacement** feature.

Textures of wall, floor and model are replaced by `replace_obj_texture()` function, and position and orientation of the model are also variated using `locate_object()` function.

These models are prepared to mimic the dataset of DeepMind's [SCAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03389).
